It really wasn’t all THAT difficult. For starters, all I had to do was : Create a New Repo on my Github account with a name that was anything other than my username.github.io by Forking the fastpages repo. This would basically create a copy of the demo Fastpages site on my created Repo, but you won’t see any changes or a Github Page just yet. To get that to happen, you’ll have to merge the PR that gets raised on this newly created repo. For example, my new repo was called : reluctant-forecaster. And my Github user name is abhicantdraw. So my new page would be abhicantdraw.github.io/reluctant-forecaster. And that’s it. The content that was available on the demo FastPages page is now also available on your new repo-ed page.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fastpages Notebook Blog Post</title><link href="https://abhicantdraw.github.io/reluctant-forecaster/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fastpages Notebook Blog Post" /><published>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://abhicantdraw.github.io/reluctant-forecaster/jupyter/2020/02/20/test</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://abhicantdraw.github.io/reluctant-forecaster/images/chart-preview.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://abhicantdraw.github.io/reluctant-forecaster/images/chart-preview.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
